# Court Reminder Experiment
**Designing and evaluating reminder interventions to reduce missed court appearances**

## Overview
People often miss court appearances not because they are unwilling or defiant, but because court systems are confusing, intimidating, and easy to forget. When a court date is missed, the consequences can include arrest warrants, detention, and cascading harms, especially on low-income individuals. This project documents the design and decision-making process behind a large-scale court reminder field experiment currently in recruitment and pre-implementation.

## Problem Statement
Failure to appear (FTA) in court is a common and costly problem for courts and communities. Traditional responses often treat missed appearance as willful noncompliance, rather than as a usability and communication failure issue.

This project reframes it into a UX problem and examine how courts communicate expectations, timing, and logistics to people navigating an intimidating system.
