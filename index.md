# Court Reminder Experiment
**Designing and evaluating reminder interventions to reduce missed court appearances**

## Overview
People often miss court appearances not because they are unwilling or defiant, but because court systems are confusing, intimidating, and easy to forget. When a court date is missed, the consequences can include arrest warrants, detention, and cascading harms, especially on low-income individuals. This project documents the design and decision-making process behind a large-scale court reminder field experiment currently in recruitment and pre-implementation.

## Problem Statement
Failure to appear (FTA) in court is a common and costly problem for courts and communities. Traditional responses often treat missed appearance as willful noncompliance, rather than as a usability and communication failure issue. When attempting to estimate the causal impact of reminder interventions through large-scale field experiments, this framing introduces a critical ethical constraint, that is, maintaining a traditional control group would require withholding reimnders from a randomly selected group of individuals. This is unethical because it potentially exposes them to avoidable harm within the justice system. 

This project reframes it into a UX problem and examine how courts communicate expectations, timing, and logistics to people navigating an intimidating system. 

## Research Questions
1. Do reminder messages reduce failure to appear?
2. How does **frequency** of reminders affect outcomes?
3. How do **communication modes** (e.g., text, email, or both) compare?
4. Does providing **courthouse directions** improve attendance?
5. How can we evaluate these interventions ethically in real court settings?
